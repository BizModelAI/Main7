# Signup Error Fixes

## Problem

The `/api/auth/signup` endpoint was returning 500 Internal Server Error with HTML content instead of JSON, causing frontend JSON parsing errors.

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue was likely caused by:

1. **Production environment differences** - Vercel environment vs development
2. **Error handling returning HTML** - Server errors were being converted to HTML error pages
3. **Missing error boundaries** - Unhandled errors bypassing JSON response logic
4. **Database connection issues** - Potential production database connectivity problems

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling in Signup Endpoint

- ✅ Added comprehensive try-catch blocks for each operation
- ✅ Added specific error handling for database operations
- ✅ Added password hashing error handling
- ✅ Added validation for request body structure
- ✅ Ensured Content-Type header is always set to `application/json`

### 2. JSON Response Enforcement Middleware

- ✅ Added middleware to override `res.send()` for all `/api/*` routes
- ✅ Converts HTML error responses to JSON automatically
- ✅ Ensures `Content-Type: application/json` header is always set
- ✅ Prevents HTML error pages from reaching the frontend

### 3. Database Connection Safeguards

- ✅ Added transaction-based operations for data consistency
- ✅ Added connection pool monitoring and error handling
- ✅ Added database test endpoint for debugging (`/api/test/database`)
- ✅ Enhanced error logging with stack traces and context

### 4. Production-Specific Handling

- ✅ Created Vercel API route (`/api/auth/signup.ts`) as backup
- ✅ Added global error handlers for unhandled rejections
- ✅ Added final error handler middleware for emergency situations
- ✅ Environment-specific error details (dev vs production)

### 5. Request Validation Improvements

- ✅ Added request body validation before processing
- ✅ Enhanced email and password validation
- ✅ Better error messages for validation failures
- ✅ Added sessionID generation safeguards

## Error Response Format

All errors now return consistent JSON format:

```json
{
  "error": "Human-readable error message",
  "details": "Technical details (dev only)",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-13T18:02:52.291Z"
}
```

## Testing Results

- ✅ **Valid signup**: Returns user object with temporary session
- ✅ **Invalid email**: Returns 400 with validation error
- ✅ **Missing fields**: Returns 400 with field requirement error
- ✅ **Existing user**: Returns 409 with conflict error
- ✅ **Database errors**: Returns 500 with proper JSON error
- ✅ **Network errors**: Caught and converted to JSON

## Production Deployment

The fixes ensure that:

1. **Vercel functions** work correctly with the backup API route
2. **Express routes** are properly protected with error boundaries
3. **Database operations** are resilient to connection issues
4. **All responses** are guaranteed to be valid JSON

## Monitoring

Added diagnostic endpoints:

- `/api/health/detailed` - Comprehensive system health
- `/api/test/database` - Database connectivity testing

## Prevention

These safeguards prevent:

- ❌ HTML error pages being returned for API calls
- ❌ JSON parsing errors in the frontend
- ❌ Unhandled database connection failures
- ❌ Password hashing failures causing 500 errors
- ❌ Session generation issues
